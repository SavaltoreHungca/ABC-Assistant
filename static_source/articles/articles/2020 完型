Even if families are less likely to sit down to eat together than was once the case, millions of Britons will none the less have partaken this weekend of one of the nation’s great traditions: the Sunday roast. On a cold winter’s day, few culinary pleasures can match it. Yet as we report now, the food police are determined that this enjoyment should be rendered yet another guilty pleasure guaranteed to damage our health. 

The Food Standards Authority (FSA) has issued a public warning about the risks of a compound called acrylamide that forms in some foods cooked at high temperatures. This means that people should avoid crisping their roast potatoes, spurn thin-crust pizzas and only partially toast their bread. But where is the evidence to support such alarmist advice? While studies have shown that acrylamide can cause neurological damage in mice, there is no conclusive evidence that it causes cancer in humans. 

Scientists say the compound is “likely to be carcinogenic” but have no hard scientific proof. On the basis of the precautionary principle, it could be argued that it is advisable to follow the FSA advice. After all, it was rumoured that smoking caused cancer for years before the evidence was found to prove a connection.

Doubtless a piece of boiled beef can always be served up on Sunday alongside some steamed vegetables,without the Yorkshire pudding and no wine. But would life be worth living? To be fair, the FSA says it is not telling people to cut out roast foods entirely, but to reduce their lifetime intake. However, their campaign risks coming across as exhortation and nannying. Constant health scares just end up with no one listening.
