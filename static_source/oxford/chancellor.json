When making decisions Scottish courts look for an appropriate general principle and apply it to a particular situation. English law relies on <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/case-law\" title=\"case law definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">case law</span></a></span>, a collection of previous decisions, called <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/precedent\" title=\"precedents definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">precedents</span></a></span>. English courts look at precedents for the <span class=\"eb\">case</span> being tried and make a similar judgement. A basic principle of law in Britain is that anyone accused is <span class=\"eb\">innocent until proven guilty</span>, so it is the job of the <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/prosecution\" title=\"prosecution definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">prosecution</span></a></span> to <span class=\"eb\">prove beyond reasonable doubt</span> that the <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/defendant\" title=\"defendant definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">defendant</span></a></span> <span class=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"gloss\">(= the person accused)</span> has broken the law as stated in the <span class=\"eb\">charge</span>.
