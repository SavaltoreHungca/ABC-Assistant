The word <span class=\"ei\">commuting</span> comes from <span class=\"eb\">commutation ticket</span>, a US ticket for repeated journeys, called a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/season-ticket\" title=\"season ticket definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">season ticket</span></a></span> in Britain. Regular travellers are called <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/commuter\" title=\"commuters definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">commuters</span></a></span>.</span><span class=\"p\">The US has many commuters. A few, mostly on the East Coast, commute by train or <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/subway#subway_sng_1\" title=\"subway definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">subway</span></a>, but most depend on the car. Some leave home very early to avoid the traffic jams, and sleep in their cars until their office opens. Many people accept a long trip to work so that they can live in quiet <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bedroom-community\" title=\"bedroom communities definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">bedroom communities</span></a></span> away from the city.</span><span class=\"p\">Millions of people in Britain commute by car or train. Some spend two or three hours a day travelling, so that they and their families can live in <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/suburbia\" title=\"suburbia definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">suburbia</span></a></span> or in the countryside. Cities are surrounded by <span class=\"eb\">commuter belts</span>. Part of the commuter belt around London is called the <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stockbroker-belt\" title=\"stockbroker belt definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">stockbroker belt</span></a></span> because it contains houses where rich business people live. Some places are known as <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/dormitory-town\" title=\"dormitory towns definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">dormitory towns</span></a></span> (<span class=\"ei\">NAmE</span> <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bedroom-community\" title=\"bedroom community definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">bedroom community</span></a></span>), because people sleep there but take little part in local activities.</span><span class=\"p\">Most commuters travel to and from work at the same time, causing the morning and evening <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rush-hour\" title=\"rush hours definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">rush hours</span></a></span>, when buses and trains are crowded and there are <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/traffic-jam\" title=\"traffic jams definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">traffic jams</span></a></span> on the roads. Commuters on trains usually spend their journey reading, sleeping or using their computers or mobile phones. Increasing numbers of people now work at home some days of the week, linked to their offices by computer, a practice called <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/telecommuting\" title=\"telecommuting definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">telecommuting</span></a></span> or <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/teleworking\" title=\"teleworking definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">teleworking</span></a></span>.</span><span class=\"p\">Cities in both Britain and the US are trying to reduce the number of cars coming into town each day. Some companies encourage <span class=\"eb\">car <span class=\"ndv\" tofix=\"\" href=\"pool_subentryg_2:pool_topg_3\">pooling</span></span> (called <span class=\"eb\">car sharing</span> in Britain), an arrangement for people who live and work near each other to travel together. Some US cities have a public service that helps such people to contact each other, and parts of the road are reserved for car-pool vehicles. But cars and fuel are cheap in the US, and many people prefer to drive alone because it gives them more freedom. Many cities have <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/park-and-ride\" title=\"park-and-ride definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">park-and-ride</span></a></span> schemes, car parks on the edge of the city from which buses take drivers into the centre. In Britain in 2002 a system of <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/congestion-charging\" title=\"congestion charging definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">congestion charging</span></a> was introduced in <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/durham#durham_ng_2\" title=\"Durham definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Durham</span></a> to make people who drive into the city centre pay a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/congestion-charge\" title=\"congestion charge definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">congestion charge</span></a></span> <span class=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"gloss\">(= pay money to drive into the city centre)</span>. A similar system was introduced in London in 2003. </span></span></span></div><div class=\"collapse\" htag=\"div\" hclass=\"collapse\"><span class=\"unbox\" id=\"commuter_unbox_2\" unbox=\"extra_examples\"><span class=\"box_title\">Extra Examples</span><ul class=\"examples\" hclass=\"examples\" htag=\"ul\"><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">A group of regular commuters were playing cards.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">About a million commuters use the rail network every day.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">Commuter services are under a greater strain then ever before.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">Commuters are angry at the increase in rail fares.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">Commuters from Essex to London face a nightmare journey today.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">I could hear the commuter traffic in the distance.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">She lives in a small commuter town, 25 miles from San Francisco.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">The accident involved a crowded commuter train.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">The developments are in the London commuter belt.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">The train was packed with commuters.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">The village has become the preserve of rich commuters and second home owners.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">There has been an increase in the numbers of daily commuters into London.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">There have been improvements to commuter lines.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">We need to encourage commuters not to drive into the city.</span></li></ul></span></div><div class=\"collapse\" htag=\"div\" hclass=\"collapse\"><span class=\"unbox\" id=\"commuter_unbox_3\" unbox=\"snippet\"><span class=\"box_title\">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class=\"body\"><span class=\"p\"><span class=\"eb\">Commuter</span> is used before these nouns: <ul class=\"collocs_list\"><li class=\"li\" bord=\"n\">belt</li><li class=\"li\" bord=\"n\">line</li><li class=\"li\" bord=\"n\">rail</li><li class=\"li\">…</li></ul></span><span class=\"xref_to_full_entry\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/commuter\" title=\" definition in Collocations\n \">full entry</a></span></span></span></div>    \n</li></ol><span class=\"dictlink-g\"><span class=\"dictlink\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/commuter\" title=\" definition in American English\n \"><span class=\"xh\">commuter</span></a> in the Oxford Advanced American Dictionary</span></span><div class=\"pron-link\">Check pronunciation:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/commuter\">commuter</a></div></div>\n","matches":[],"relatives":[],"nearBys":["commute verb","commute noun","commuter noun","Perry Como","Comoran noun, adjective"]},[]]
