class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/local-government\" title=\"local government definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">local government</span></a></span> is slightly different in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England is divided into <span class=\"eb\">counties</span> each with a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/county-council\" title=\"county council definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">county council</span></a></span> which is responsible for certain services. Each county is divided again into <span class=\"eb\">districts</span>, each with a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/district-council\" title=\"district council definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">district council</span></a></span> responsible for a smaller area. Districts are further divided into <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/parish\" title=\"parishes definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">parishes</span></a></span> which were originally villages with churches. In some parts of England, there are instead <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/unitary-authority\" title=\"unitary authorities definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">unitary authorities</span></a></span> which have just one level of local government responsible for an area or city, sometimes called a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/metropolitan\" title=\"metropolitan definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">metropolitan</span></a> district</span>. London has a separate system with an elected <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/assembly\" title=\"Assembly definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Assembly</span></a> and a <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mayor\" title=\"mayor definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">mayor</span></a>. In Scotland, there are 32 <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/council-area\" title=\"council areas definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">council areas</span></a></span>. Wales is divided into 22 counties and <span class=\"eb\">county boroughs</span> and Northern Ireland has 11 districts. All of these are unitary authorities with one level of local government.</span><span class=\"p\">Councils consist of <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/councillor\" title=\"councillors definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">councillors</span></a></span> who are representatives elected by local people for a period of four years. Most councillors belong to a <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/political\" title=\"political definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">political</span></a> party and, especially at county level, people often vote for them as representatives of a party, not as individuals. Since the Local Government Act of 2000, councils have been led by a <span class=\"eb\">council leader</span> and a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cabinet\" title=\"cabinet definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">cabinet</span></a></span> of councillors, or a <span class=\"eb\">directly elected mayor</span> and a cabinet.

Many people are employed by councils, but many services are also now carried out by private companies who are given contracts by the council. Councils receive some money from central government in the form of <span class=\"eb\">grants</span>, they also collect <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/council-tax\" title=\"council tax definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">council tax</span></a></span> from each household, a tax based on the value of the house.</span><span class=\"p\">In the US, local government has three levels, with the <span class=\"eb\">State government</span>, <span class=\"eb\">County government</span> and below that, towns and cities. State government is organized in a similar way to the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/federal-government\" title=\"federal government definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">federal government</span></a>, with a <span class=\"eb\">state <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution\" title=\"constitution definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">constitution</span></a></span> in most states which explains the powers of the three branches of state government, the executive, the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/legislative\" title=\"legislative definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">legislative</span></a> and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/judicial\" title=\"judicial definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">judicial</span></a>. The executive branch is headed by a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/governor\" title=\"governor definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">governor</span></a></span> and state laws are made by a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/legislature\" title=\"legislature definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">legislature</span></a></span>, which usually has two houses, a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/senate\" title=\"Senate definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Senate</span></a></span> and a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-house-of-representatives\" title=\"House of Representatives definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">House of Representatives</span></a></span>. The judicial branch usually consists of a state <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-supreme-court\" title=\"supreme court definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">supreme court</span></a> and several lower courts. States have great influence and organize their own system of courts and set local <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/income-tax\" title=\"income tax definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">income tax</span></a> and sales tax.</span><span class=\"p\">States are divided into counties which have a county government located in a town or city called the <span class=\"eb\">county seat</span>. The structure of county government varies from state to state, but most countries have a <span class=\"eb\">Board of <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/commissioner\" title=\"Commissioners definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Commissioners</span></a></span>, sometimes called a <span class=\"eb\">Board of <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/supervisor\" title=\"Supervisors definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Supervisors</span></a></span>, with the Board and other county officials usually being elected. Services provided by a county government depend on the area, and whether it is mainly urban or rural. In urban areas, city and county governments may work together to provide services for the area. Counties usually have a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sheriff\" title=\"sheriff's definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">sheriff's</span></a> department</span>, a kind of police department, whose officers are called <span class=\"eb\">sheriff's <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deputy\" title=\"deputies definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">deputies</span></a></span>.</span><span class=\"p\">America's cities, towns and other <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/municipality\" title=\"municipalities definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">municipalities</span></a> vary from small towns of a few hundred people to cities of millions. For that reason, there is no single system of local government. Most towns and cities have an elected <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mayor\" title=\"mayor definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">mayor</span></a> as their head and a council, made up of elected members from different areas of the city, which makes <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ordinance\" title=\"ordinances definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">ordinances</span></a></span> <span class=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"gloss\">(= local laws)</span>. A <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/municipal\" title=\"municipal definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">municipal</span></a>

Wales is divided into 22 counties and <span class=\"eb\">county boroughs</span> and Northern Ireland has 11 districts.

Services provided by a county government depend on the area, and whether it is mainly urban or rural. In urban areas, city and county governments may work together to provide services for the area. Counties usually have a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sheriff\" title=\"sheriff's definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">sheriff's</span></a> department</span>, a kind of police department, whose officers are called <span class=\"eb\">sheriff's <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deputy\" title=\"deputies definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">deputies</span></a></span>.</span><span class=\"p\">America's cities, towns and other <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/municipality\" title=\"municipalities definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">municipalities</span></a> vary from small towns of a few hundred people to cities of millions.
