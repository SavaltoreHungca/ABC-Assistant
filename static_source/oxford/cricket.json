In England, it is played between April and September at many levels, from informal games on the beach to matches between schools, villages and professional sides representing a county. Players usually play wearing white, although this is now being replaced in some competitions by coloured clothing. Cricket is played by both men and women, but there are no official mixed teams and men and women do not play against each other. </span><span class=\"p\">Cricket is a complicated game played with wooden <span class=\"eb\"><span class=\"ndv\" tofix=\"\" href=\"bat_subentryg_1:bat_topg_3\">bats</span></span> and a hard leather ball.
