you are writing or speaking English it is important to use language that includes both men and women equally. Some people may be very offended if you do not.</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">The human race</span><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">Man</span> and <span class=\"eb\">mankind</span> have traditionally been used to mean ‘all men and women’. Many people now prefer to use <span class=\"eb\">humanity</span>, <span class=\"eb\">the human race</span>, <span class=\"eb\">human beings</span> or <span class=\"eb\">people</span>.</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">Jobs</span><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\">The suffix <span class=\"eb\">-ess</span> in names of occupations such as <span class=\"eb\">actress</span>, <span class=\"eb\">hostess</span> and <span class=\"eb\">waitress</span> shows that the person doing the job is a woman. Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class=\"eb\">actor</span> or <span class=\"eb\">host</span> (although <span class=\"eb\">actress</span> and <span class=\"eb\">hostess</span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class=\"eb\">server</span> for <span class=\"ei\">waiter</span> and <span class=\"ei\">waitress</span>. </li><li class=\"li\">Many job names ending in <span class=\"ei\">-man</span> also have a female equivalent ending <span class=\"ei\">-woman</span> (eg <span class=\"eb\">postman/​postwoman</span>), but in some cases one equivalent is rarely or never used, especially in old-fashioned job names that were traditionally done by one sex (eg <span class=\"eb\">coalman</span>, <span class=\"eb\">washerwoman</span>). Other forms such as <span class=\"eb\">batswoman</span> and <span class=\"eb\">tradeswoman</span> are becoming more common as more women start to do these jobs.</li><li class=\"li\">Neutral words like <span class=\"eb\">assistant</span>, <span class=\"eb\">worker</span>, <span class=\"eb\">person</span> or <span class=\"eb\">officer</span> are now often used instead of <span class=\"ei\">-man</span> or <span class=\"ei\">-woman</span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class=\"eb\">police officer</span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">policeman</span> or <span class=\"ei\">policewoman</span>, and <span class=\"eb\">spokesperson</span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">spokesman</span> or <span class=\"ei\">spokeswoman</span>. Neutral words are very common in newspapers, on television and radio and in official writing, in both <span class=\"labels\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"labels\">British English</span> and <span class=\"labels\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"labels\">North American English</span>.</li><li class=\"li\">When talking about jobs that are traditionally done by the other sex, some people say: <span class=\"eb\">a male secretary</span>/<span class=\"eb\">nurse</span>/<span class=\"eb\">model</span> (NOT <span class=\"eb\">man</span>) or <span class=\"eb\">a woman</span>/<span class=\"eb\">female</span> <span class=\"eb\">doctor</span>/<span class=\"eb\">barrister</span>/<span class=\"eb\">driver</span>. However, this is now not usually done unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man/​woman: <span class=\"unx\">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.</span><span class=\"unx\">They have a male nanny for their kids.</span><span class=\"unx\">a female racing driver</span></li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">Pronouns</span><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">He</span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.</span> This is not now acceptable. Instead, after <span class=\"eb\">everybody</span>, <span class=\"eb\">everyone</span>, <span class=\"eb\">anybody</span>, <span class=\"eb\">anyone</span>, <span class=\"eb\">somebody</span>, <span class=\"eb\">someone</span>, etc. one of the plural pronouns <span class=\"eb\">they</span>, <span class=\"eb\">them</span>, and <span class=\"eb\">their</span> is often used: <span class=\"unx\">Does everybody know what they want?</span><span class=\"unx\">Somebody’s left their coat here.</span><span class=\"unx\">I hope nobody’s forgotten to bring their passport with them.</span></li><li class=\"li\">It is now generally acceptable in writing and speech to use <span class=\"eb\">they</span>, <span class=\"eb\">them</span>, and <span class=\"eb\">their</span> to refer to a singular noun: <span class=\"unx\">When a guest arrives, they check in and we show them to their room.</span> However, some people prefer to use <span class=\"eb\">he or she</span>, <span class=\"eb\">his or her</span>, or <span class=\"eb\">him or her</span>: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone knows what’s best for him- or herself.</span> <span class=\"eb\">He/​she</span> or <span class=\"eb\">(s)he</span> can also be used in writing: <span class=\"unx\">If in doubt, ask your doctor. He/​she can give you more information.</span> (You may find that some writers just use ‘she’.) If these uses seem awkward, you can change the sentence and use a plural noun. Instead of saying: <span class=\"unx\">A baby cries when he or she is tired</span> you can say <span class=\"unx\">Babies cry when they are tired.</span></li><li class=\"li\">Some people now specify which pronouns they prefer to be used when they are referred to, usually according to their <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gender-identity\" title=\"gender identity definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">gender identity</span></a>: <span class=\"unx\">I want to share with you that I am trans, and my pronouns are ‘they’ and

Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class=\"eb\">actor</span> or <span class=\"eb\">host</span> (although <span class=\"eb\">actress</span> and <span class=\"eb\">hostess</span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class=\"eb\">server</span> for <span class=\"ei\">waiter</span> and <span class=\"ei\">waitress</span>. </li><li class=\"li\">Many job names ending in <span class=\"ei\">-man</span> also have a female equivalent ending <span class=\"ei\">-woman</span> (eg <span class=\"eb\">postman/​postwoman</span>), but in some cases one equivalent is rarely or never used, especially in old-fashioned job names that were traditionally done by one sex (eg <span class=\"eb\">coalman</span>, <span class=\"eb\">washerwoman</span>). Other forms such as <span class=\"eb\">batswoman</span> and <span class=\"eb\">tradeswoman</span> are becoming more common as more women start to do these jobs.</li><li class=\"li\">Neutral words like <span class=\"eb\">assistant</span>, <span class=\"eb\">worker</span>, <span class=\"eb\">person</span> or <span class=\"eb\">officer</span> are now often used instead of <span class=\"ei\">-man</span> or <span class=\"ei\">-woman</span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class=\"eb\">police officer</span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">policeman</span> or <span class=\"ei\">policewoman</span>, and <span class=\"eb\">spokesperson</span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">spokesman</span> or <span class=\"ei\">spokeswoman</span>. Neutral words are very common in newspapers, on television and radio and in official writing, in both <span class=\"labels\" hclass=\"labels\" htag=\"span\">British English</span> and <span class=\"labels\" hclass=\"labels\" htag=\"span\">North American English</span>.</li><li class=\"li\">When talking about jobs that are traditionally done by the other sex, some people say: <span class=\"eb\">a male secretary</span>/<span class=\"eb\">nurse</span>/<span class=\"eb\">model</span> (NOT <span class=\"eb\">man</span>) or <span class=\"eb\">a woman</span>/<span class=\"eb\">female</span> <span class=\"eb\">doctor</span>/<span class=\"eb\">barrister</span>/<span class=\"eb\">driver</span>. However, this is now not usually done unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man/​woman: <span class=\"unx\">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.</span><span class=\"unx\">They have a male nanny for their kids.</span><span class=\"unx\">a female racing driver</span></li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">Pronouns</span><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">He</span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.</span> This is not now acceptable.
