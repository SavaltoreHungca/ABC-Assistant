Some people may be very offended if you do not.</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">The human race</span><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">Man</span> and <span class=\"eb\">mankind</span> have traditionally been used to mean ‘all men and women’. Many people now prefer to use <span class=\"eb\">humanity</span>, <span class=\"eb\">the human race</span>, <span class=\"eb\">human beings</span> or <span class=\"eb\">people</span>.</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">Jobs</span><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\">The suffix <span class=\"eb\">-ess</span> in names of occupations such as <span class=\"eb\">actress</span>, <span class=\"eb\">hostess</span> and <span class=\"eb\">waitress</span> shows that the person doing the job is a woman. Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class=\"eb\">actor</span> or <span class=\"eb\">host</span> (although <span class=\"eb\">actress</span> and <span class=\"eb\">hostess</span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class=\"eb\">server</span> for <span class=\"ei\">waiter</span> and <span class=\"ei\">waitress</span>. </li><li class=\"li\">Many job names ending in <span class=\"ei\">-man</span> also have a female equivalent ending <span class=\"ei\">-woman</span> (eg <span class=\"eb\">postman/​postwoman</span>), but in some cases one equivalent is rarely or never used, especially in old-fashioned job names that were traditionally done by one sex (eg <span class=\"eb\">coalman</span>, <span class=\"eb\">washerwoman</span>). Other forms such as <span class=\"eb\">batswoman</span> and <span class=\"eb\">tradeswoman</span> are becoming more common as more women start to do these jobs.</li><li class=\"li\">Neutral words like <span class=\"eb\">assistant</span>, <span class=\"eb\">worker</span>, <span class=\"eb\">person</span> or <span class=\"eb\">officer</span> are now often used instead of <span class=\"ei\">-man</span> or <span class=\"ei\">-woman</span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class=\"eb\">police officer</span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">policeman</span> or <span class=\"ei\">policewoman</span>, and <span class=\"eb\">spokesperson</span> instead of <span class=\"ei\">spokesman</span> or <span class=\"ei\">spokeswoman</span>. Neutral words are very common in newspapers, on television and radio and in official writing, in both <span class=\"labels\" hclass=\"labels\" htag=\"span\">British English</span> and <span class=\"labels\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"labels\">North American English</span>.</li><li class=\"li\">When talking about jobs that are traditionally done by the other sex, some people say: <span class=\"eb\">a male secretary</span>/<span class=\"eb\">nurse</span>/<span class=\"eb\">model</span> (NOT <span class=\"eb\">man</span>) or <span class=\"eb\">a woman</span>/<span class=\"eb\">female</span> <span class=\"eb\">doctor</span>/<span class=\"eb\">barrister</span>/<span class=\"eb\">driver</span>. However, this is now not usually done unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man/​woman: <span class=\"unx\">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.</span><span class=\"unx\">They have a male nanny for their kids.</span><span class=\"unx\">a female racing driver</span></li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">Pronouns</span><ul class=\"bullet\"><li class=\"li\"><span class=\"eb\">He</span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.</span> This is not now acceptable. Instead, after <span class=\"eb\">everybody</span>, <span class=\"eb\">everyone</span>, <span class=\"eb\">anybody</span>, <span class=\"eb\">anyone</span>, <span class=\"eb\">somebody</span>, <span class=\"eb\">someone</span>, etc. one of the plural pronouns <span class=\"eb\">they</span>, <span class=\"eb\">them</span>, and <span class=\"eb\">their</span> is often used: <span class=\"unx\">Does everybody know what they want?</span><span class=\"unx\">Somebody’s left their coat here.</span><span class=\"unx\">I hope nobody’s forgotten to bring their passport with them.</span></li><li class=\"li\">It is now generally acceptable in writing and speech to use <span class=\"eb\">they</span>, <span class=\"eb\">them</span>, and <span class=\"eb\">their</span> to refer to a singular noun: <span class=\"unx\">When a guest arrives, they check in and we show them to their room.</span> However, some people prefer to use <span class=\"eb\">he or she</span>, <span class=\"eb\">his or her</span>, or <span class=\"eb\">him or her</span>: <span class=\"unx\">Everyone knows what’s best for him- or herself.</span> <span class=\"eb\">He/​she</span> or <span class=\"eb\">(s)he</span> can also be used in writing: <span class=\"unx\">If in doubt, ask your doctor. He/​she can give you more information.</span> (You may find that some writers just use ‘she’.) If these uses seem awkward, you can change the sentence and use a plural noun. Instead of saying: <span class=\"unx\">A baby cries when he or she is tired</span> you can say <span class=\"unx\">Babies cry when they are tired.</span></li><li class=\"li\">Some people now specify which pronouns they prefer to be used when they are referred to, usually according to their <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gender-identity\" title=\"gender identity definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">gender identity</span></a>: <span class=\"unx\">I want to share with you that I am trans, and my pronouns are ‘they’ and ‘them’.</span></li></ul></span></span></div> <span class=\"xrefs\" xt=\"cp\" hclass=\"xrefs\" htag=\"span\"><span class=\"prefix\">compare</span> <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/womankind\" title=\"womankind definition\"><span class=\"xr-g\" href=\"womankind_e\" bord=\"y\"><span class=\"xh\">womankind</span></span></a></span> <span class=\"xrefs\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"xrefs\" xt=\"see\"><span class=\"prefix\">see also</span> <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/humankind\" title=\"humankind definition\"><span class=\"xr-g\" bord=\"n\" href=\"humankind_e\"><span class=\"xh\">humankind</span></span></a></span><div class=\"collapse\" htag=\"div\" hclass=\"collapse\"><span class=\"unbox\" id=\"mankind_unbox_2\" unbox=\"extra_examples\"><span class=\"box_title\">Extra Examples</span><ul class=\"examples\" htag=\"ul\" hclass=\"examples\"><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">I believe that war is one of the major evils facing mankind.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">It is doubtful whether this research is of any benefit to mankind.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">Mankind has marvelled at diamonds for at least 2 000 years.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">Their remote location meant that they were isolated from the rest of mankind.</span></li></ul></span></div><div class=\"collapse\" hclass=\"collapse\" htag=\"div\"><span class=\"unbox\" id=\"mankind_unbox_3\" unbox=\"snippet\"><span class=\"box_title\">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class=\"body\"><span class=\"unbox\">verb + mankind</span><ul class=\"collocs_list\"><li class=\"li\">save</li><li class=\"li\">destroy</li><li class=\"li\">benefit</li><li class=\"li\">…</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">phrases</span><ul class=\"collocs_list\"><li class=\"li\">all mankind</li><li class=\"li\">the whole of mankind</li><li class=\"li\">benefit to mankind</li><li class=\"li\">…</li></ul><span class=\"xref_to_full_entry\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/mankind\" title=\" definition in Collocations\n \">full entry</a></span></span></span></div>    \n</li></ol><span class=\"dictlink-g\"><span class=\"dictlink\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/mankind\" title=\" definition in American English\n \"><span class=\"xh\">mankind</span></a> in the Oxford Advanced American Dictionary</span><span class=\"dictlink\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/academic/mankind\" title=\" definition in Academic English\n \"><span class=\"xh\">mankind</span></a> in the Oxford Learner's Dictionary of Academic English</span></span><div class=\"pron-link\">Check pronunciation:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/mankind\">mankind</a></div></div>\n","matches":[],"relatives":[],"nearBys":["manipulator noun","Manitoba","mankind noun","manky adjective","manliness noun"]},[]]
