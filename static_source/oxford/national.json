class=\"ndv\">national parks</span></a></span> began in the US. The majority of them are in western states. The <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/national-park-service\" title=\"National Park Service definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">National Park Service</span></a> is responsible for protecting the natural state of the parks for the benefit of the public. America's parks are so popular that they are being harmed by the number of visitors and their cars. To try to stop this, the National Park Service encourages the development of public transport in the parks.</span><span class=\"p\">The oldest national park in the world is <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/yellowstone-national-park\" title=\"Yellowstone National Park definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Yellowstone National Park</span></a>, established in 1872. The largest US park is Wrangell St Elias in <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/alaska\" title=\"Alaska definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Alaska</span></a> with 13 000 square miles/34 000 square kilometres. It has few visitors because it is very remote. The most popular park is the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-great-smoky-mountains#the_great_smoky_mountains_topg_1\" title=\"Great Smoky Mountains definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Great Smoky Mountains</span></a>. Many parks are well known for some special feature, such as the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-grand-canyon#the_grand_canyon_topg_1\" title=\"Grand Canyon definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Grand Canyon</span></a>, the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-everglades#the_everglades_topg_1\" title=\"Everglades definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Everglades</span></a> and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-petrified-forest#the_petrified_forest_topg_1\" title=\"Petrified Forest definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Petrified Forest</span></a>.</span><span class=\"p\">There are many other sites run by the National Park Service. One of the most visited areas is the Blue Ridge Parkway in <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/virginia\" title=\"Virginia definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Virginia</span></a> and <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/north-carolina\" title=\"North Carolina definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">North Carolina</span></a>.

Most have water sports and other activities. <span class=\"eb\">National <span class=\"ndv\" tofix=\"\" href=\"preserve_subentryg_1:preserve_topg_2\">preserves</span></span> are similar to national parks but are not as well protected. Companies can even search for oil and gas on them. Many of the national preserves are in Alaska, including the oldest, <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/denali\" title=\"Denali definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Denali</span></a>, established in 1917.</span><span class=\"p\">The US Bureau of Land Management is in charge of many of the <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/wilderness\" title=\"wilderness definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">wilderness</span></a> areas</span> created by the government. Visitors can camp in wilderness areas if they follow the ‘leave no <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trace_1\" title=\"trace definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">trace</span></a> ’ policy. Native North American people are allowed to use them for religious ceremonies.</span><span class=\"p\">National parks are also important in Britain as areas for people to enjoy themselves outdoors. The land is not owned by the public; it is mostly owned by farmers and other private individuals. The first two to be established were the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-lake-district#the_lake_district_topg_1\" title=\"Lake District definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Lake District</span></a> and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-peak-district#the_peak_district_topg_1\" title=\"Peak District definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Peak District</span></a> in 1951 and there are now 15 national parks, which attract many thousands of visitors each year. The aim is to keep the National Parks as far as possible in their natural state, while balancing the different needs of farming, industry, housing and tourism. Many of the people who live in national parks depend on tourists for their living and are used to crowded roads in summer. A more serious problem is that some visitors who go regularly to a national park buy houses in the area as second homes. This means there is less property for local people to buy and many are forced to move.</span><span class=\"p\">Each park is managed by a National Park Authority. The government provides much of the money to run the parks. National Park Authorities control development within each park, look after <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/public-footpath#public_footpath_topg_1\" title=\"public footpaths definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">public footpaths</span></a> and run information and study centres. Some of the land in national parks is owned by the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-national-trust\" title=\"National Trust definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">National Trust</span></a> but a lot is <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/privately\" title=\"privately definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">privately</span></a> owned.</span><span class=\"p\">Some other areas, such as the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-gower-peninsula#the_gower_peninsula_topg_1\" title=\"Gower Peninsula definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Gower Peninsula</span></a> and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-malverns#the_malverns_topg_1\" title=\"Malverns definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Malverns</span></a>, are protected by law as <span class=\"eb\">areas of outstanding natural beauty</span> (<span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/aonb\" title=\"AONBs definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">AONBs</span></a></span>).

From there he could watch the battle for control of Fort McHenry. The song tells how he watched as the sun went down. He could no longer see the fighting, but since bombs were still exploding he knew that the British had not won.
