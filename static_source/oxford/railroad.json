In 1994 the government decided that BR should return to being owned by private companies. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railtrack\" title=\"Railtrack definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Railtrack</span></a>, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis.</span><span class=\"p\">The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via a high-speed service and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-channel-tunnel#the_channel_tunnel_topg_1\" title=\"Channel Tunnel definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Channel Tunnel</span></a>, links Britain with France and Belgium. People are encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce the amount of fuel being used and pollution. Railways are used for both short and long journeys, for <span class=\"ndv\" tofix=\"\" href=\"commute_subentryg_1:commute_topg_2\" xt=\"andv\">commuting</span> to work each day, and for transporting <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/freight_1\" title=\"freight definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">freight</span></a></span> <span class=\"gloss\" hclass=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\">(= goods)</span>. Some routes are now <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/electrify\" title=\"electrified definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">electrified</span></a> and have high-speed trains.

Some trains are old, dirty and carry too many people. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included ‘leaves on the line’ in autumn, and ‘the wrong kind of snow’. Tickets are quite expensive, although some people, including students and older people, can get <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railcard\" title=\"railcards definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">railcards</span></a></span> which allow buy tickets at a reduced price.

The 20th century brought more powerful engines and huge stations, like <span class=\"ndv\" tofix=\"\" xt=\"andv\" href=\"grandcentralstation_d_1\">Grand Central Station</span> (officially Grand Central Terminal) in New York. The greatest period of US railroads began in the middle of the 19th century and lasted about 100 years.

Union Pacific, once known for its two-level ‘dome lounge cars’ from which passengers could see the countryside they travelled through, stopped long-distance passenger services in 1971. <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/amtraktm#amtrak_topg_1\" title=\"Amtrak definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Amtrak</span></a>, a company controlled by the government, now runs the California Zephyr, the Texas Eagle and other trains but it is not very successful in attracting passengers.</span><span class=\"p\">Some Americans are <span class=\"eb\">train <span class=\"ndv\" tofix=\"\" href=\"buff_subentryg_1:buff_topg_2\">buffs</span></span> <span class=\"gloss\" hclass=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\">(= people who love trains and know a lot about them)</span> and take special steam engine trips.

In 1994 the government decided that BR should return to being owned by private companies. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railtrack\" title=\"Railtrack definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Railtrack</span></a>, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis.</span><span class=\"p\">The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via a high-speed service and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-channel-tunnel#the_channel_tunnel_topg_1\" title=\"Channel Tunnel definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Channel Tunnel</span></a>, links Britain with France and Belgium. People are encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce the amount of fuel being used and pollution. Railways are used for both short and long journeys, for <span class=\"ndv\" xt=\"andv\" href=\"commute_subentryg_1:commute_topg_2\" tofix=\"\">commuting</span> to work each day, and for transporting <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/freight_1\" title=\"freight definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">freight</span></a></span> <span class=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"gloss\">(= goods)</span>.

Some trains are old, dirty and carry too many people. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included ‘leaves on the line’ in autumn, and ‘the wrong kind of snow’. Tickets are quite expensive, although some people, including students and older people, can get <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railcard\" title=\"railcards definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">railcards</span></a></span> which allow buy tickets at a reduced price.

The 20th century brought more powerful engines and huge stations, like <span class=\"ndv\" href=\"grandcentralstation_d_1\" xt=\"andv\" tofix=\"\">Grand Central Station</span> (officially Grand Central Terminal) in New York. The greatest period of US railroads began in the middle of the 19th century and lasted about 100 years.
