In 1994 the government decided that BR should return to being owned by private companies. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railtrack\" title=\"Railtrack definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Railtrack</span></a>, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis.</span><span class=\"p\">The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via a high-speed service and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-channel-tunnel#the_channel_tunnel_topg_1\" title=\"Channel Tunnel definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Channel Tunnel</span></a>, links Britain with France and Belgium. People are encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce the amount of fuel being used and pollution.

Some trains are old, dirty and carry too many people. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included ‘leaves on the line’ in autumn, and ‘the wrong kind of snow’. Tickets are quite expensive, although some people, including students and older people, can get <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railcard\" title=\"railcards definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">railcards</span></a></span> which allow buy tickets at a reduced price.

The 20th century brought more powerful engines and huge stations, like <span class=\"ndv\" href=\"grandcentralstation_d_1\" xt=\"andv\" tofix=\"\">Grand Central Station</span> (officially Grand Central Terminal) in New York. The greatest period of US railroads began in the middle of the 19th century and lasted about 100 years.

In 1994 the government decided that BR should return to being owned by private companies. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railtrack\" title=\"Railtrack definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Railtrack</span></a>, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis.</span><span class=\"p\">The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via a high-speed service and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-channel-tunnel#the_channel_tunnel_topg_1\" title=\"Channel Tunnel definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Channel Tunnel</span></a>, links Britain with France and Belgium. People are encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce the amount of fuel being used and pollution.

Some trains are old, dirty and carry too many people. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included ‘leaves on the line’ in autumn, and ‘the wrong kind of snow’. Tickets are quite expensive, although some people, including students and older people, can get <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/railcard\" title=\"railcards definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">railcards</span></a></span> which allow buy tickets at a reduced price.
