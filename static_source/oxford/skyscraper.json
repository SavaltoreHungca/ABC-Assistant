The first were built in <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chicago\" title=\"Chicago definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Chicago</span></a> in the late 1880s but they have since been copied all over the world. After 1916 the top few floors of skyscrapers were usually built gradually narrower, floor by floor, to allow more light to reach street level.</span><span class=\"p\">Many of the most famous skyscrapers are in New York City. The <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-chrysler-building#the_chrysler_building_topg_1\" title=\"Chrysler Building definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Chrysler Building</span></a>, at 1 047 feet/319 metres, was by far the tallest building in the world in 1930 when it was built.

The <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-twin-towers\" title=\"Twin Towers definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Twin Towers</span></a>, built in the early 1970s, were about 1 368 feet/417 metres tall. Many visitors to <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/new-york\" title=\"New York definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">New York</span></a> took the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ferry_1\" title=\"ferry definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">ferry</span></a> to <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/staten-island\" title=\"Staten Island definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Staten Island</span></a> so that they could see the <span class=\"eb\">Manhattan skyline</span>, the outline of all the tallest buildings in New York.</span><span class=\"p\">The tallest building in the US is <span class=\"eb\">One World Trade Center</span> in New York. It is 1776 feet/541 metres high, with 104 floors. The <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-willis-tower\" title=\"Willis Tower definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Willis Tower</span></a>, commonly referred to as the Sears Tower, in <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/chicago\" title=\"Chicago definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Chicago</span></a> is 1 450 feet/443 metres high with 110 floors, and is currently the second-tallest building in the US.</span><span class=\"p\">By comparison with skyscrapers in the US, those in Britain are rather small. The <span class=\"eb\">Shard</span> (1016 feet/310 metres) near <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/london-bridge\" title=\"London Bridge definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">London Bridge</span></a> replaced <span class=\"eb\">One Canada Square</span> (771 feet/235 metres) in<a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/canary-wharf\" title=\"Canary Wharf definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Canary Wharf</span></a> in London's <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/docklands\" title=\"Docklands definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Docklands</span></a> as Britain's tallest building. Other skyscrapers in the City of London include the <span class=\"eb\">Lloyds Building</span>, designed by Richard Rogers and <span class=\"eb\">30 St Mary Axe</span> (known as the <span class=\"eb\">Gherkin</span>), designed by Norman Foster.</span><span class=\"p\">Skyscrapers which contain people's homes are, in Britain, usually called <span class=\"eb\">high-rises</span> or <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tower-block\" title=\"tower blocks definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">tower blocks</span></a></span>. They became a common feature of British cities when hundreds of them were built to replace <span class=\"ndv\" href=\"slum_subentryg_1:slum_topg_2\" tofix=\"\">slums</span> <span class=\"gloss\" hclass=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\">(= areas of small, old houses with few modern facilities)</span> in the 1950s and 1960s. Many are 20 or 30 floors high, and have several flats on each floor. At first, high-rises were welcomed because they provided cheap, modern housing but later they were not considered good places to live. Many suffered from lack of repair and have been pulled down. Following the fire at Grenfell Tower in London in 2017, experts have been looking at how to make tower blocks safer. </span></span></span></div><div class=\"collapse\" hclass=\"collapse\" htag=\"div\"><span class=\"unbox\" id=\"skyscraper_unbox_2\" unbox=\"extra_examples\"><span class=\"box_title\">Extra Examples</span><ul class=\"examples\" htag=\"ul\" hclass=\"examples\"><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">Chicago's skyline of gleaming skyscrapers</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">He found himself approaching a forest of skyscrapers.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">On all sides, skyscrapers rose like jagged teeth.</span></li><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"unx\">The skyscraper towered over the surrounding buildings.</span></li></ul></span></div><span class=\"topic-g\"><span class=\"prefix\">Topics </span><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/buildings?level=b1\" title=\"Topic buildings\"><span class=\"topic\" href=\"l2:homes_and_buildings:buildings?cefr=b1\"><span class=\"topic_name\">Buildings</span><span class=\"topic_cefr\">b1</span></span></a></span><div class=\"collapse\" htag=\"div\" hclass=\"collapse\"><span class=\"unbox\" id=\"skyscraper_unbox_3\" unbox=\"snippet\"><span class=\"box_title\">Oxford Collocations Dictionary</span><span class=\"body\"><span class=\"unbox\">adjective</span><ul class=\"collocs_list\"><li class=\"li\">giant</li><li class=\"li\">huge</li><li class=\"li\">tall</li><li class=\"li\">…</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">… of skyscrapers</span><ul class=\"collocs_list\"><li class=\"li\">forest</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">verb + skyscraper</span><ul class=\"collocs_list\"><li class=\"li\">build</li><li class=\"li\">surround</li></ul><span class=\"unbox\">skyscraper + verb</span><ul class=\"collocs_list\"><li class=\"li\">loom</li><li class=\"li\">rise</li><li class=\"li\">tower above somebody/​something</li><li class=\"li\">…</li></ul><span class=\"xref_to_full_entry\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/collocations/skyscraper\" title=\" definition in Collocations\n \">full entry</a></span></span></span></div>    \n</li></ol><span class=\"dictlink-g\"><span class=\"dictlink\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/skyscraper\" title=\" definition in American English\n \"><span class=\"xh\">skyscraper</span></a> in the Oxford Advanced American Dictionary</span></span><div class=\"pron-link\">Check pronunciation:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/skyscraper\">skyscraper</a></div></div>\n","matches":[],"relatives":[],"nearBys":["Skypecast noun","skyrocket verb","skyscraper noun","sky surfing noun","skywards adverb"]},[]]
