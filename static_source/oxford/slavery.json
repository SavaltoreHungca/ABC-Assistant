definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Slavery</span></a></span> has been practised in many countries, but played a particularly important role in the history of the US. The first <span class=\"eb\">slaves</span>, who were considered to be the property of another person and to have no rights of their own, were taken from Africa to North America by the Dutch in 1619 and by the time of the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-american-revolution#the_american_revolution_topg_1\" title=\"American Revolution definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">American Revolution</span></a> (1775) there were 500 000 slaves, mostly in the South. Slaves were taken from Africa in ships in very bad conditions, with many dying during the trip. Once they arrived, they worked mainly on cotton <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/plantation\" title=\"plantations definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">plantations</span></a> where the quality of their lives depended on the treatment they received from their <span class=\"eb\">master</span>.</span><span class=\"p\">After the Revolution, northern states made slavery illegal, but it continued in the South. It became illegal to bring slaves into the US in 1808, but by then many were being born there, so slave markets continued. In the 1830s opposition to slavery grew from the <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/abolitionist\" title=\"abolitionist definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">abolitionist</span></a> movement</span>, whose leaders included William Lloyd Garrison who published an anti-slavery newspaper, <span class=\"ebi\">The Liberator</span> and <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/harriet-beecher-stowe\" title=\"Harriet Beecher Stowe definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</span></a> who wrote a famous novel about a slave called <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/uncle-tom-s-cabin\" title=\"Uncle Tom's Cabin definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span></a>. In 1831 a former slave, <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nat-turner\" title=\"Nat Turner definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Nat Turner</span></a> organized an <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/uprising\" title=\"uprising definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">uprising</span></a> of slaves in <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/virginia\" title=\"Virginia definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Virginia</span></a> and in 1859 a white man, <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/john-brown\" title=\"John Brown definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">John Brown</span></a> tried to free some slaves. The work of the <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-underground-railroad#the_underground_railroad_topg_1\" title=\"Underground Railroad definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Underground Railroad</span></a></span> had more effect, trying to help slaves escape to the North, and some people hoped to end slavery by sending slaves back to Africa, creating the new country <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/liberia\" title=\"Liberia definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Liberia</span></a> in 1822. Laws were made to limit slavery, but the South wanted it to expand and politicians found it increasingly difficult to agree. In 1820 the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-missouri-compromise#the_missouri_compromise_topg_1\" title=\"Missouri Compromise definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Missouri Compromise</span></a> said that <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/missouri\" title=\"Missouri definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Missouri</span></a> would be admitted to the US as a <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/slave-state\" title=\"slave state definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">slave state</span></a></span> <span class=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"gloss\">(= one where slavery was allowed)</span> and <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/maine\" title=\"Maine definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Maine</span></a> as a <span class=\"eb\">free state</span> <span class=\"gloss\" hclass=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\">(= where slavery was not allowed)</span>. However, conflict between the North and South increased and in 1861 the slave states left the US, marking the start of the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/civil-war\" title=\"Civil War definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Civil War</span></a>.</span><span class=\"p\">After the North won the Civil War and brought southern states back into the US, slavery was ended, but conditions did not improve for many slaves. Some moved to the North, but many of those who stayed in the South continued to work on the plantations where they were paid for their work but didn't get enough money to pay for food and clothes.</span><span class=\"p\">The British were also involved in slavery from the 17th century when many slaves were taken from Africa to British <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/colony\" title=\"colonies definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">colonies</span></a> in the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/caribbean_1\" title=\"Caribbean definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Caribbean</span></a> to work on sugar plantations. Many businessmen made a lot of money from the <span class=\"eb\">triangular trade</span> between Britain, Africa and the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-west-indies\" title=\"West Indies definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">West Indies</span></a>. They transported cloth and iron goods to West Africa and exchanged them for slaves who were then taken to the West Indies and exchanged for sugar which was taken back to <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bristol\" title=\"Bristol definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Bristol</span></a> and other British ports for sale in Europe. The <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/quaker_2#quaker_topg_1\" title=\"Quakers definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">Quakers</span></a> were among the first people to campaign against slavery and it was made illegal in Britain in 1772, but campaigns led by <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/william-wilberforce\" title=\"William Wilberforce definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">William Wilberforce</span></a> and others then grew for the total <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/abolition\" title=\"abolition definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">abolition</span></a> of the <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/slave-trade\" title=\"slave trade definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">slave trade</span></a></span>. It was not until 1807 that it was made illegal for British ships to carry slaves and for British colonies to import them, and slavery was not finally abolished in the <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-british-empire#the_british_empire_topg_1\" title=\"British Empire definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">British Empire</span></a> until 1833, when all slaves were set free and their owners were given money.</span><span class=\"p\">Despite the general belief that slavery no longer exists, there is growing evidence that it continues today in various forms, and that it is becoming a serious problem. People who need work are encouraged to go to richer countries such as Britain and the US, where they believe they will have a better life. Women may then be forced to work as <span class=\"ndv\" href=\"prostitute_subentryg_1:prostitute_topg_2\" tofix=\"\">prostitutes</span> <span class=\"gloss\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"gloss\">(= people who have sex for money)</span> and men are often forced to do hard labour. They receive some food and a little money, but not enough to be able to escape. This situation is referred to as <span class=\"eb\">modern slavery</span>.</span></span></span></div><span class=\"dictlink-g\"><span class=\"dictlink\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/slavery\" title=\" definition in American English\n \"><span class=\"xh\">slavery</span></a> in the Oxford Advanced American Dictionary</span><span class=\"dictlink\">See <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/academic/slavery\" title=\" definition in Academic English\n \"><span class=\"xh\">slavery</span></a> in the Oxford Learner's Dictionary of Academic English</span></span><div class=\"pron-link\">Check pronunciation:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/slavery\">slavery</a></div></div>\n","matches":["modern slavery noun"],"relatives":["modern slavery noun"],"nearBys":["slaver1 verb","slaver2 noun","slavery noun","slave state noun","slave trade noun"]},[{"name":"modern slavery","pos":"noun","content":"<div class=\"entry\" hlength=\"14\" id=\"modern-slavery\" htag=\"section\" sk=\"modernslavery: :0\" sum=\"336\" hclass=\"entry\" idm_id=\"000038353\"><div class=\"top-container\"><div class=\"top-g\" id=\"modernslavery_topg_1\"><div class=\"webtop\"><h1 class=\"headword\" htag=\"h1\" id=\"modernslavery_h_1\" hclass=\"headword\">modern slavery</h1> <span class=\"pos\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"pos\">noun</span><span class=\"phonetics\"> <div class=\"phons_br\" wd=\"modern slavery\" hclass=\"phons_br\" geo=\"br\" htag=\"div\"><div class=\"sound audio_play_button pron-uk icon-audio\" data-src-mp3=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/uk_pron/m/mod/moder/modern_slavery_1_gb_1.mp3\" data-src-ogg=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/uk_pron_ogg/m/mod/moder/modern_slavery_1_gb_1.ogg\" title=\"modern slavery pronunciation\n                    English\" style=\"cursor: pointer\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</div><span class=\"phon\">/ˌmɒdn ˈsleɪvəri/</span></div> <div class=\"phons_n_am\" geo=\"n_am\" htag=\"div\" hclass=\"phons_n_am\" wd=\"modern slavery\"><div class=\"sound audio_play_button pron-us icon-audio\" data-src-mp3=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/us_pron/m/mod/moder/modern_slavery_1_us_1.mp3\" data-src-ogg=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/us_pron_ogg/m/mod/moder/modern_slavery_1_us_1.ogg\" title=\"modern slavery pronunciation\n                    American\" style=\"cursor: pointer\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;</div><span class=\"phon\">/ˌmɑːdərn ˈsleɪvəri/</span></div></span> <span class=\"grammar\" hclass=\"grammar\" htag=\"span\">[uncountable]</span></div><a class=\"responsive_display_inline_on_smartphone link-right\" href=\"#relatedentries\">\n                            jump to other results\n                        </a></div></div><ol class=\"sense_single\" htag=\"ol\"><li class=\"sense\" fkcefr=\"c1\" hclass=\"sense\" id=\"modernslavery_sng_1\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"sensetop\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"sensetop\"><span class=\"def\" htag=\"span\" hclass=\"def\">a form of <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/slavery\" title=\"slavery definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">slavery</span></a> that exists in the 21st century, in which people are illegally forced to work and prevented from escaping</span></span><ul class=\"examples\" hclass=\"examples\" htag=\"ul\"><li class=\"\" htag=\"li\"><span class=\"x\">It is estimated that millions of people around the world are victims of modern slavery.</span></li></ul><span class=\"topic-g\"><span class=\"prefix\">Topics </span><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/crime-and-punishment?level=c1\" title=\"Topic crime-and-punishment\"><span class=\"topic\" href=\"l2:politics_and_society:crime_and_punishment?cefr=c1\"><span class=\"topic_name\">Crime and punishment</span><span class=\"topic_cefr\">c1</span></span></a><span class=\"sep\">,</span> <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/topic/social-issues?level=c1\" title=\"Topic social-issues\"><span class=\"topic\" href=\"l2:politics_and_society:social_issues?cefr=c1\"><span class=\"topic_name\">Social issues</span><span class=\"topic_cefr\">c1</span></span></a></span>    \n</li></ol><div class=\"pron-link\">Check pronunciation:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/modern-slavery\">modern slavery</a></div></div>\n","matches":[],"relatives":[],"nearBys":["modernize verb","modern language noun","modern slavery noun","Modern Times","modest adjective"]}]]
