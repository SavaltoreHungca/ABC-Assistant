Colleges of further education run courses to provide a <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/theoretical\" title=\"theoretical definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">theoretical</span></a> background. NVQs are awarded at five levels on the basis of practical work, spoken and written tests, and <a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/coursework\" title=\"coursework definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">coursework</span></a>. </span><span class=\"p\"><span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/btec\" title=\"BTEC definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">BTEC</span></a></span> (Business and Technology Education Council) qualifications can be taken across a wide range of vocational subjects at various levels.

Much vocational training is done by private institutions which are sometimes called <span class=\"eb\">proprietary schools</span>. Although many of these are good, in general they have a bad reputation. This is partly because there are no controls over who can operate such a school. Some proprietary schools try to take money from as many students as possible, including some who will probably not be able to complete their training.</span><span class=\"p\">Most US secondary schools programmes do not provide a choice between an academic and a practical programme of study, but most do give students an opportunity to take some practical or vocational classes. Large school districts may have <span class=\"eb\"><a class=\"Ref\" href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/magnet-school\" title=\"magnet schools definition\"><span class=\"ndv\">magnet schools</span></a></span>, schools that attract students with certain interests, and some of these may have a larger choice of vocational courses.</span></span></span></div><span
